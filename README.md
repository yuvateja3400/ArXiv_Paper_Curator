## 📖 About This Course

This is a **POC project** where you'll build a complete research assistant system that automatically fetches academic papers, understands their content, and answers your research questions using advanced RAG techniques.

**The arXiv Paper Curator** will teach you to build a **production-grade RAG system using industry best practices**. You'll master the architecture, implementation, and deployment of AI systems that professionals use in the real world.

By the end of this Project, you'll have your own AI research assistant and the skills to build similar systems for any domain.
